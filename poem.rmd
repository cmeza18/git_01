## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

A boat beneath a sunny sky,  
Lingering onward dreamily  
In an evening of July â€”  

Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->

Loveliests of trees, the cherry now  
Is hung with bloom along the bough,  
And stands about the woodland ride  
Wearing white for Eastertide   

Now, of my threescore years and ten,  
Twenty will not come again,  
And take from seventy springs a score,  
It only leaves me fifty more.  

And since to look at things in bloom  
Fifty springs are little room,  
About the woodlands I will go  
To see the cherry hung with snow.
